## ðŸ¤– Introduction

Tsundere is a japanese term used to describe characters who are initially cold and hostile towards others, 
but gradually show a more warmer and friendlier side to them. 

TsunderAI is a chatbot that uses artificial intelligence ([openAI's GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/)) 
to simulate how a tsundere character would answer to the user's messages.

## ðŸ”¨ How it works

To try it yourself you can access [this link](https://dbuzon.github.io/tsundere-bot/) and have a chat with TsunderAI. 
You just have to type something in the input field, and hit enter or click the send button. Don't forget to be kind! ðŸ˜Š
